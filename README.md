# Merge audio with video
This Repository contains a script that is used to convert and merge audio file with video media into an mp4 video.<br>
I have created this repository because Pluralsight website encryptes <br>
the downloaded courses and u can't access the matrial.<br>
the only way i was able to get the courses matrial is to download videos and audios separately  <br>
of each course and merge every audio with it's video , but doing that manually is very exhausting <br>
This script automates this process <br>

I hope you can find it helpfull.<br>

Thanks...

# Dependencies
The script is written in python <br>

You need to have ```ffmepg``` library <br>

to install just type ```pip install ffmpeg-python``` <br>
