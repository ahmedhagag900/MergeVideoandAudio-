## MergeVideoandAudio
This Repository contains script that's convert and merge the audio and video into mp4 video.<br>
I have created this repository because of the the Pluralsight courses website encrypte <br>
the courses and u cant access the matrial<br>
the only way i was able get the courses matrial is to download videos and audios separately  <br>
of each course and merge every audio with it's video <br>
so i made this repo<br>

I hope u can find it helpfull<br>

Thanks...
## Dependencies
The script is written in python <br>
u need to have ```ffmepg``` library <br>
