## MergeVideoandAudio
This Repository contains script that's convert and merge the audio and video into mp4 video.
I have created this repository because of the the Pluralsight courses website encrypte 
the courses and u cant access the matrial
the only way i was able get the courses matrial is to download videos and audios separately  
of each course and merge every audio with it's video 
so i made this repo

I hope u can find it helpfull

Thanks...
## Dependencies
The script is written in python
u need to have ```python ffmepg``` library
